Notes to developers:

- Note that the README file is automatically generated from the main
  page of the doxygen documentation by running "make doc" (or "make
  readme").

- To check that all the code is working:

  make check
  make distcheck
  make check with --enable-debug

  Do this both from inside and outside sources.

- The following tools are necessary to generate all documentation (any
  flavor of "make dist" will fail if these tools are not available):

  - doxygen with man, pdf and html support
  - help2man
  - fig2dev
  - w3m

- Create a distribution tarball by running the following (from the
  top-level source directory):

  shell$ ./contrib/dist/make_dist_tarball

  It will take a few minutes because it runs "make distcheck" and it
  builds two tarballs (an official release and a greek release).  For
  example, after "make_dist_tarball" completes, you'll have two
  tarballs, like this:

  hwloc-0.9.1.tar.gz
  hwloc-0.9.1rc1.tar.gz

  The "rc1" tarball (or whatever the greek version is) can be
  distributed for testing and validation.  If it passes, then the
  non-rc1 tarball can be released (it's identical to the rc1 tarball
  except for its version).

- Check tarballs by configuring and building them and then running
  "make check".

- For the windows zipball, make sure you have Microsoft's lib tool in
  PATH, and remember to copy README at the root of the zip into a
  README.txt file.

- make maintainer-clean can be used to properly remove the generated
  documentations.
