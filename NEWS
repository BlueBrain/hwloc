This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of hwloc since version
0.9 (as initially released as "libtopology", then re-branded to "hwloc"
in v0.9.1).

Version 0.9.4 (unreleased)
--------------------------

* Fix reseting colors to normal in lstopo -.txt output.
* Fix Linux pthread_t binding error report.


Version 0.9.3
-------------

* Fix autogen.sh to work with Autoconf 2.63.
* Fix various crashes in particular conditions:
  - xml files with root attributes
  - offline CPUs
  - partial sysfs support
  - unparseable /proc/cpuinfo
  - ignoring NUMA level while Misc level have been generated
* Tweak documentation a bit
* Do not require the pthread library for binding the current thread on Linux
* Do not erroneously consider the sched_setaffinity prototype is the old version
  when there is actually none.
* Fix _syscall3 compilation on archs for which we do not have the
  sched_setaffinity system call number.
* Fix AIX binding.
* Fix libraries dependencies: now only lstopo depends on libtermcap, fix
  binutils-gold link
* Have make check always build and run hwloc-hello.c
* Do not limit size of a cpuset.


Version 0.9.2
-------------

* Trivial documentation changes.


Version 0.9.1
-------------

* Re-branded to "hwloc" and moved to the Open MPI project, relicensed under the
  BSD license.
* The prefix of all functions and tools is now hwloc, and some public
  functions were also renamed for real.
* Group NUMA nodes into Misc objects according to their physical distance
  that may be reported by the OS/BIOS.
  May be ignored by setting HWLOC_IGNORE_DISTANCES=1 in the environment.
* Ignore offline CPUs on Solaris.
* Improved binding support on AIX.
* Add HP-UX support.
* CPU sets are now allocated/freed dynamically.
* Add command line options to tune the lstopo graphic output, add
  semi-graphical text output
* Extend topobind to support multiple cpusets or objects on the command
  line as topomask does.
* Add an Infiniband-specific helper hwloc/openfabrics-verbs.h to retrieve
  the physical location of IB devices.


Version 0.9 (libtopology)
-------------------------

* First release.
