Version 0.9.1

  functions were also renamed for real.

  that may be reported by the OS/BIOS.
  May be ignored by setting HWLOC_IGNORE_DISTANCES=1 in the environment.
* Ignore offline CPUs on Solaris.
* Improved binding support on AIX.
* Add HP-UX support.
* CPU sets are now allocated/freed dynamically.
