\section Introduction

hwloc provides command line tools and a C API to obtain the
hierarchical map of key computing elements, such as: NUMA memory
nodes, shared caches, processor sockets, processor cores, and
processor "threads".  hwloc also gathers various attributes such as
cache and memory information, and is portable across a variety of
different operating systems and platforms.

hwloc primarily aims at helping high-performance computing (HPC)
applications, but is also applicable to any project seeking to exploit
code and/or data locality on modern computing platforms.

*** Note that the hwloc project represents the merger of the
libtopology project from INRIA and the Portable Linux Processor
Affinity (PLPA) sub-project from Open MPI.  <em>Both of these prior
projects are now deprecated.</em> The first hwloc release is essentially a
"re-branding" of the libtopology code base, but with both a few
genuinely new features and a few PLPA-like features added in.  More
new features and more PLPA-like features will be added to hwloc over
time. See \ref switchfromplpa for more details about converting
your application from PLPA to hwloc.

hwloc supports the following operating systems:

<ul>
<li>Linux (including old kernels not having sysfs topology
information, with knowledge of cpusets, offline cpus, and Kerrighed
support)</li>
<li>Solaris</li>
<li>AIX</li>
<li>Darwin / OS X</li>
<li>OSF/1 (a.k.a., Tru64)</li>
<li>HP-UX</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows</li>
</ul>

hwloc only reports the number of processors on unsupported operating
systems; no topology information is available.

For development and debugging purposes, hwloc also offers the ability to
work on "fake" topologies:

<ul>
  <li> Symmetrical tree of resources generated from a list of level arities</li>
  <li> Remote machine simulation through the gathering of Linux sysfs topology files</li>
</ul>

hwloc can display the topology in a human-readable format, either in
graphical mode (X11), or by exporting in one of several different
formats, including: plain text, PDF, PNG, and FIG (see Examples
below).  Note that some of the export formats require additional
support libraries.

hwloc offers a programming interface for manipulating topologies and
objects. It also brings a powerful CPU bitmap API that is used to
describe topology objects location on physical/logical processors. See
the \ref interface below. It may also be used to binding applications
onto certain cores or memory nodes. Several utility programs are also
provided to ease command-line manipulation of topology objects,
binding of processes, and so on.

\section installation Installation

hwloc (http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) is available under the
BSD license.  It is hosted as a sub-project of the overall Open MPI
project (http://www.open-mpi.org/).  Note that hwloc does not require
any functionality from Open MPI -- it is a wholly separate (and much
smaller!) project and code base.  It just happens to be hosted as part
of the overall Open MPI project.

Nightly development snapshots are available on the web site.
Additionally, the code can be directly checked out of Subversion:

\code
shell$ svn checkout http://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/hwloc/trunk hwloc-trunk
shell$ cd hwloc-trunk
shell$ ./autogen.sh
\endcode

Note that GNU Autoconf >=2.60, Automake >=1.10 and Libtool >=2.2.6 are
required when building from a Subversion checkout.

Installation by itself is the fairly common GNU-based process:

\code
shell$ ./configure --prefix=...
shell$ make
shell$ make install
\endcode

The hwloc command-line tool "lstopo" produces human-readable topology
maps, as mentioned above.  It can also export maps to the "fig" file
format.  Support for PDF, Postscript, and PNG exporting is provided if
the "Cairo" development package can be found when hwloc is configured
and build.  Similarly, lstopo's XML support requires the libxml2
development package.

\section interface Programming interface

The basic interface is available in hwloc.h. It mostly offers
low-level routines for advanced programmers that want to manually
manipulate objects and follow links between them.  Developers should
look at hwloc/helper.h, which provides good higher-level topology
traversal examples.

Each object contains a cpuset describing the list of processors that
it contains.  These cpusets may be used for \ref hwlocality_binding.
hwloc offers an extensive cpuset manipulation interface in
hwloc/cpuset.h.

Moreover, hwloc also comes with additional helpers for
interoperability with several commonly used environments.  For Linux,
some specific helpers are available in hwloc/linux.h, and
hwloc/linux-libnuma.h if using libnuma.  On glibc-based systems,
additional helpers are available in hwloc/glibc-sched.h.  For Linux
systems with the OpenFabrics verbs library, some dedicated helpers are
provided in hwloc/openfabrics-verbs.h (this helper file is not yet
useful on non-Linux systems with the OpenFabrics verbs library).

To precisely define the vocabulary used by hwloc, a \ref glossary is
available and should probably be read first.

Further documentation is available in a full set of HTML pages, man
pages, and self-contained PDF files (formatted for both both US letter
and A4 formats) in the source tarball in doc/doxygen-doc/.  If you are
building from a Subversion checkout, you will need to have Doxygen and
pdflatex installed -- the documentation will be built during the
normal "make" process.  The documentation is installed during "make
install" to $prefix/share/doc/hwloc/ and your systems default man page
tree (under $prefix, of course).

The following section presents an example of API usage.

\section interface_example API example

The following small C example (named ``hwloc-hello.c'') prints the
topology of the machine and bring the process to the first processor
of the second core of the machine.

\include hwloc-hello.c

hwloc provides a \c pkg-config executable to obtain relevant compiler
and linker flags.  For example, it can be used thusly to compile
applications that utilize the hwloc library (assuming GNU Make):

\verbatim
CFLAGS += $(pkg-config --cflags hwloc)
LDLIBS += $(pkg-config --libs hwloc)
cc hwloc-hello.c $(CFLAGS) -o hwloc-hello $(LDLIBS)
\endverbatim

On a machine with 4GB of RAM and 2 processor sockets -- each socket of
which has two processor cores -- the output from running \c
hwloc-hello could be something like the following:

\verbatim
shell$ ./hwloc-hello
*** Objects at level 0

\section history History / credits

hwloc is the evolution and merger of the libtopology
(http://runtime.bordeaux.inria.fr/libtopology/) project and the Portable
Linux Processor Affinity (PLPA) (http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/plpa/)
project. Because of functional and ideological overlap, these two code bases
and ideas were merged and released under the name "hwloc" as an Open MPI
sub-project.

libtopology was initially developed by the INRIA Runtime Team-Project
(http://runtime.bordeaux.inria.fr/) (headed by Raymond Namyst
(http://dept-info.labri.fr/~namyst/). PLPA was initially developed by
the Open MPI development team as a sub-project. Both are now deprecated
in favor of hwloc, which is distributed as an Open MPI sub-project.

\page glossary Glossary

<dl>

<dt>Object</dt>
  <dd>Interesting kind of part of the system, such as a Core, a Cache,
  a Memory node, etc. The different types detected by hwloc are
  detailed in the ::hwloc_obj_type_t enumeration.
  
  They are topologically sorted by CPU set into a tree whose root is
  the System object (which always exists).
  </dd>

<dt>CPU set</dt>
  <dd>The set of logical processors logically included in an object
  (if any).  This term does \em not have any relation to an operating
  system ``CPU set.''</dd>

<dt>Father object</dt>
  <dd>The object logically containing the current object, for example
  because its CPU set includes the CPU set of the current object.</dd>

<dt>Children object(s)</dt>
  <dd>The object (or objects) contained in the current object because
  their CPU set is included in the CPU set of the current object.</dd>

<dt>Arity</dt>
  <dd>The number of children of an object.</dd>

<dt>Sibling objects</dt>
  <dd>Objects of the same type which have the same father.</dd>

<dt>Sibling rank</dt>
  <dd>Index to uniquely identify objects of the same type which have
  the same father, and is always in the range [0, fathers_arity).</dd>

<dt>Cousin objects</dt>
  <dd>Objects of the same type as the current object.</dd>

<dt>Level</dt>
  <dd>Set of objects of the same type.</dd>

<dt>OS index</dt>
  <dd>The index that the operating system (OS) uses to identify the
  object.  This may be completely arbitrary, or it may depend on the
  BIOS configuration.</dd>

<dt>Depth</dt>
  <dd>Nesting level in the object tree, starting from the 0th object
  (i.e., the System object).</dd>

<dt>Logical index</dt>
  <dd>Index to uniquely identify objects of the same type.  It is
  generally used to express proximity.  This index is always linear
  and in the range [0, num_objs_same_type_same_level).  Think of it as
  ``cousin rank.''</dd>

</dl>

The following diagram can help to understand the vocabulary of the
relationships by showing the example of a machine with two dual core
sockets (with no hardware threads); thus, a topology with 4 levels.

It should be noted that for Processor objects, the logical index -- as
computed linearly by hwloc -- is not the same as the OS index.



\page tools Command-line tools 

hwloc comes with an extensive C programming interface and several
command line utilities. Each of them is fully documented in its
own manual page.

<dt>lstopo (also known as hwloc-info and hwloc-ls)</dt>
  <dd>displays the hierarchical topology of the current system
  in a graphic or textual outputs. It may also display other system
  topologies thanks to XML input files for instance.
  </dd>

<dt>hwloc-bind</dt>
  <dd>lets you bind processes to specific hardware objects
  through a flexible syntax. It may also retrieve the current binding.
  </dd>

<dt>hwloc-mask</dt>
  <dd>generates cpuset strings from given hardware objects
  with the ability to aggregate them, intersect them, and more.
  These cpuset strings may for instance be passed to hwloc-bind for binding.
  hwloc-mask may also generate list of logical processors or NUMA nodes
  that are convenient to pass to some external tools such as taskset or
  numactl.
  </dd>

<dt>hwloc-distrib</dt>
  <dd>hwloc-distrib generates a set of cpuset strings that are uniformly
  distributed across the machine for the given number of processes.
  These strings may be used with hwloc-bind to run processes so as to
  maximize their memory bandwidth.
  </dd>



\page envvar Environment variables

The behavior of the hwloc library and tools may be tuned thanks to the
following environment variables.

<dt>HWLOC_XMLFILE=/path/to/file.xml</dt>
  <dd>enforces the discovery from the given XML file as if
  hwloc_topology_set_xml() had been called.
  This file may have been generated earlier with lstopo file.xml.
  For conveniency, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just
  return success.  To have hwloc still actually call OS-specific hooks,
  HWLOC_THISSYSTEM should be set 1 in the environment too, to assert that
  the loaded file is really the underlying system.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_FSROOT=/path/to/linux/filesystem-root/</dt>
  <dd>switches to reading the topology from the specified
  Linux filesystem root instead of the main file-system root, as if
  hwloc_topology_set_fsroot() had been called.
  Not using the main file-system root causes hwloc_topology_is_thissystem()
  to return 0.
  For conveniency, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just
  return success.  To have hwloc still actually call OS-specific hooks,
  HWLOC_THISSYSTEM should be set 1 in the environment too, to assert that
  the loaded file is really the underlying system.
  </dd>

<dt>HWLOC_THISSYSTEM=1</dt>
  <dd>enforces the return value of hwloc_topology_is_thissystem().
  It means that it makes hwloc assume that the selected backend provides the
  topology for the system on which we are running, even if it is not the
  OS-specific backend but the XML backend for instance.
  This means making the binding functions actually call the OS-specific
  system calls and really do binding, while the XML backend would otherwise
  provide empty hooks just returning success.
  This can be used for efficiency reasons to first detect the topology once,
  save it to an XML file, and quickly reload it later through the XML
  backend, but still having binding functions actually do bind.
