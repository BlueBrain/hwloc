Introduction
============

libtopology provides a portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures,
...) of the hierarchical topology of modern architectures. It primarily aims at
helping high-performance computing application with gathering information about
the hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.

libtopology provides a hierarchical view of the machine, NUMA memory nodes,
sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers
various attributes such as cache and memory information.

libtopology supports the following operationg systems:

  * Linux (including old kernels not having sysfs topology information, with
  knowledge of cpusets and offline cpus)
  * Solaris
  * AIX
  * OSF/1 (aka. Tru64)
  * Windows
  * For other OSes, only the number of processors is available for now.

For development and debugging purposes, libtopology also offers the ability to
work on fake topologies:

  * Symmetrical tree of resources generated from a list of level arities
  * Remote machine simulation through the gathering of Linux sysfs topology files

libtopology may also display the topology in a convenient format, either in
graphical mode, or by exporting in PDF, PNG, FIG, ... format, or in text mode
(see Examples below).

libtopology offers a programming interface for manipulating topologies and
objects. It also brings a powerful cpu bitmap API that is used to describe
topology objects location on physical/logical processors. See the Interface
below. It may also be used to binding applications onto certain cores or
memory nodes. Several utility programs are also provided to ease command-line
manipulation of topology objects, binding of processes, ...


Dependencies
============

Check-outs from the subversion repository need an

$ autoreconf -vfi

step, which requires autoconf >=2.60, automake >=1.10 and libtool >=2.2.6.


Installation
============

$ ./configure ...
$ make
$ sudo make install


Documentation
=============

Detailed documentation is available in several formats in doc/doxygen-doc
