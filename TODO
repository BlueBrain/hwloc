* integrate marcel split quirk?
  + split for real, just explain how to split?
* integrate synthetic topology support
* backport cpuset support in topology-linux.c

API:
* add a lt_topo_merge() merging everything possible (or just a level)
  + or add som flags to lt_topo_init
* add lt_topo_split()? 
* add a way to extract sched_setaffinity masks from arrays of levels (OR'ed)
  + or bind directly?
* add a way to extract libnuma-friendly masks of nodes from arrays of levels (OR'ed)
  + no level = empty mask, and we may want an easy alias for "whole machine"
* add reverse-routines converting sched_getaffinity or libnuma masks into a ancestor level


Binding tool for OAR, MPI, Hydra, MPI+OpenMP:
* lt_taskset --ncpus 2 --near 3
  bind process on 2 cores near physical proc id 3
* lt_taskset --ncpus 2 --index 4
  bind process on the 4th set of 2 physically close ids (used by ggrun when launching 4 process with 2 threads)
* lt_taskset --on <Machine/Node/Die/L3/L2/Core/L1/Proc/<depth>>:<index>
  bind process on object #index in level given by name or depth
