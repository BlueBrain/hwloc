Notes to developers:

- README is automatically generated from the main page of the doxygen
documentation by running make doc . The website is update by running make
doc-upload.

- To release a tarball, the following is necessary to generate all
documentations:
  - doxygen with man, pdf and html support
  - help2man
  - fig2dev
and the following should be performed to prepare the tarball:

autoreconf -fi && ./configure && make && make maintainer-clean && ./configure && make doc && make distclean

- make maintainer-clean can be used to properly remove the generated
documentations.
