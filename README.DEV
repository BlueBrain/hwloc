Notes to developers:

- README is automatically generated from the main page of the doxygen
documentation by running make doc . The website is update by running make
doc-upload.

- To check:
make check
make distcheck
make check with --enable-debug

Do this both from inside and outside sources.

- To release a tarball, the following is necessary to generate all
documentations:
  - doxygen with man, pdf and html support
  - help2man
  - fig2dev
and the following should be performed to prepare the tarball (yes, from inside
the source, to put the documentation inside the source):

svn export . /tmp/hwloc
cd /tmp/hwloc
autoreconf -fi && ./configure && make && make maintainer-clean && ./configure && make doc && make distclean

and check it by

cd .. && rm -fr build && mkdir build && cd build && ../hwloc/configure && make && make distcheck

For the windows zipball, make sure you have Microsoft's lib tool in PATH, and
remember to copy README at the root of the zip into a README.txt file with CRLF:

sed -e 's/$/'$'\015'/ < README > $prefix/README.txt

- make maintainer-clean can be used to properly remove the generated
documentations.
