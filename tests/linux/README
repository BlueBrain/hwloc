This directory contains tarballs of Linux sysfs hierarchies collected on
various machines.  Each tarball `xyz.tar.gz' comes with the corresponding
`xyz.tar.gz.output', which gives the expected output of "lstopo -v -" for
that machine.

Together with the `TOPO_FSYS_ROOT_PATH' environment variable, these are
used by `test-topologies.sh' to check for any regression introduced in
libtopology detection logic.

A new topology may be added by:
* running "gather-topology.sh" on the target machine and saving the
  tarball  here
* running "lstopo -v -" on the target machine (or on the extracted
  tarball) to generate the corresponding `output' file.
* adding the tarball and output files to Makefile.am so that they are
  properly handled in "make check" and "make dist"
