This directory contains tarballs of Linux sysfs hierarchies collected on
various systems.  Each tarball `xyz.tar.gz' comes with the corresponding
`xyz.tar.gz.output', which gives the expected output of "lstopo -v -" for
that system.

Together with the `TOPO_FSYS_ROOT_PATH' environment variable, these are
used by `test-topologies.sh' to check for any regression introduced in
libtopology detection logic.

A new topology may be added by:
* running "gather-topology.sh" on the target system and saving the
  tarball and output files here.
* if lstopo is not available on the target system, running "lstopo -v -"
  on the extracted tarball to generate the corresponding `output' file
  locally.
* adding the tarball and output files to Makefile.am so that they are
  properly handled in "make check" and "make dist".

Note that when adding a XML-based output, the cpusets should be stored
with 32bits subsets.
