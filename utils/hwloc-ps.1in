.SH DESCRIPTION
.
hwloc-ps lists currently running processes and prints their identifier,
command-line and binding.
The binding may be reported as objects or cpusets.
.
The output is a plain list. If you wish to annotate the hierarchical
topology with processes so as to see how they are actual distributed
on the machine, you might want to use lstopo --ps instead.
