\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Include additional detail.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fB\-\-silent\fR
Opposite of --verbose (default).
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fB\-\-logical\fR
Display hwloc logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes (default).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fB\-\-physical\fR
Display OS/physical indexes instead of hwloc logical indexes.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fB\-\-cpuset\fR
Display the cpuset of each object.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR \fB\-\-cpuset-only\fR
Only display the cpuset of each object; do not display anything else
about the object.
.TP
\fB\-\-only\fR "type"
Only show objects of the given type.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-caches\fR
Do not show caches.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-useless\-caches\fR
Do not show caches which do not have a hierarchical impact.
.TP
\fB\-\-whole\-system\fR
Do not consider administration limitations.
.TP
\fB\-\-merge\fR
Do not show levels that do not have a hierarchical impact.
.TP
\fB\-\-synthetic\fR <specification>
Simulate a fake hierarchy (instead of discovering the topology on the
local machine).
.TP
\fB\-\-xml\fR <path>
Read topology from XML file <path> (instead of discovering the
topology on the local machine).  If <path> is "-", the standard input
is used.  XML support must have been compiled in to hwloc for this
option to be usable.
.TP
\fB\-\-fsys-root\fR <path>
Read topology from the chroot specified by <path> (instead of
discovering the topology on the local machine).  This option is
generally only available on Linux.
.TP
\fB\-\-fontsize\fR <size>
Set size of text font.
.TP
\fB\-\-gridsize\fR <size>
Set size of margin between elements.
.TP
\fB\-\-horiz\fR
Horizontal graphic layout instead of nearly 4/3 ratio.
.TP
\fB\-\-vert\fR
Vertical graphic layout instead of nearly 4/3 ratio.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Report version and exit.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
lstopo is capable of displaying a topological map of the system in a
variety of different output formats.  If no filename is specified and
the DISPLAY environment variable is set, lstopo displays the map in a
graphical window.  If no filename is specified and the DISPLAY
environment variable is
.I not
set, a text summary is displayed.  Otherwise, the filename implies
what format lstopo should use:
.
.TP
.B \-
Send a text summary to stdout.
.
.TP
.B /dev/stdout
Send a text summary to stdout.  It is effectively the same as
specifying "\-".
.
.TP
.B <filename>.txt
If the filename ends in ".txt", lstopo outputs an ASCII art
representation of the map.
.
.TP
.B \-.txt
If the entire filename is "\-.txt", lstopo outputs the same ASCII art
representation as other ".txt" filenames, but with two execeptions: 1)
the output is sent to stdout, and 2) if colors are supported on the
terminal, the ASCII art will be colorized.
.
.TP
.B <filename>.fig
If the filename ends in ".fig", lstopo outputs a representation of the
map that can be loaded in Xfig.
.
.TP
.B <filename>.pdf
If the filename ends in ".pdf" and lstopo was compiled with the proper
support, lstopo outputs a PDF representation of the map.
.
.TP
.B <filename>.ps
If the filename ends in ".ps" and lstopo was compiled with the proper
support, lstopo outputs a Postscript representation of the map.
.
.TP
.B <filename>.png
If the filename ends in ".png" and lstopo was compiled with the proper
support, lstopo outputs a PNG representation of the map.
.
.TP
.B <filename>.svg
If the filename ends in ".svn" and lstopo was compiled with the proper
support, lstopo outputs an SVG representation of the map.
.
.TP
.B <filename>.xml
If the filename ends in ".xml" and lstopo was compiled with the proper
support, lstopo outputs an XML representation of the map.
.
.PP
See the output of "lstopo --help" for a specific list of what
graphical output formats are supported in your hwloc installation.

.SH EXAMPLES
.
To display the machine topology in text mode:

    lstopo -

To display in graphical mode (assuming that the DISPLAY environment
variable is set to a relevant value):

    lstopo

To export the topology to a PNG file:

    lstopo file.png

To display a summary of the topology:

    lstopo -s

To get more details about the topology:

    lstopo -v

To only show cores:

    lstopo --only core

To show cpusets:

    lstopo --cpuset

To only show the cpusets of sockets:

    lstopo --only socket --cpuset-only

Simulate a fake hierarchy; this example shows with 2 NUMA nodes of 2
processors:

    lstopo --synthetic "n:2 2"

To count the number of logical processors in the system

   lstopo --only proc | wc -l

.SH COLORS
CPUs have varying colors in the semi-graphical and graphical output:
.TP
Green
The CPU is in the current cpu binding mask 
.TP
White
The CPU is allowed but not in the current cpu binding mask
.TP
Red
The CPU is not allowed
.TP
Black
The CPU is offline
